There are two files you can concern yourself with here:
-example_scene.py, which contains an example of a set of moves you can send to a robot.
-template_scene.py, which you can copy and make your own
-sync_drive.py should not be modified unless you know what you are doing. It is the common script that runs multiple robots.
