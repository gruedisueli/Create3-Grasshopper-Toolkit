# How to use the Ros2 project
You should follow the ros2 installation instructions found in the main readme prior to using the tools.

This workspace is based on a standard template for Ros2 projects. The Grasshopper tools we have developed ("RolyPoly") output text that can be copied into a script in this project, for running on your Create3
Generally speaking, you do not need to modify any files in our repo besides your own scripts and the setup.py script.

For this reason, it is recommended that you fork this repo and modify/add files in your own fork.

## Here's the basic procedure for adding a new set of choreographed robot moves
1. Copy the script in /src/droids_controller/droids_controller/template_scene.py and name it what you want.
1. Copy the text program that was generated by the Grasshopper script into this document by, in Grasshopper, right-clicking the panel, selecting "copy data only" and pasting into the python script.
1. Update the setup.py script to include the reference to your new python script (makes it easier to run from the command line). Your addition will go below the entry for "example_scene"
1. In a terminal window, navigate to the ros2_ws directory, and run "colcon build --symlink-install"
1. Run the command "ros2 run droids_controller {your script name}" to run your script.
